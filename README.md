# CarService_Cpp_OOP_Project
This is a project that I build in C++ to "manage" the fictive car services in Romania. Here I use all the oop concepts and working at this project made me have a better understanding of classes, inheritance, upcasting, downcasting, STL data types, interfaces and everything there is to know about oop.
